<a id="welcome-to-my-website" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-website" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my website.</h3>

<p>I am a student at Tufts University, in Medford Massachusetts. I study Latin and Classical Greek. My special interests are Digital Humanities, Renaissance Latin, and Indoeuropean Linguistics. The purpose of this website is to showcase my work in Digital Humanities and facilitate it in the future.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, Digital Humanities are the application of new tools to the study of the humanities. I am especially interested in how computers can improve the study of Classical Philology. Philology is the art of reading slowly. Tools like <a href="alpheios.net">Alpheios</a> and the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Perseus Digital Library</a> can let the reader analyze each word of a text, so they enable the ultimate close-reading. The Perseus Digital Library and the <a href="http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/">Ancient Greek and Latin Treebanks</a> also allow a very distant reading. By this I mean that the Treebanks allow the reader to run statistical and other tests on thousands of words of Greek or Latin at a time.</p>

<a id="what-are-treebanks" class="anchor" href="#what-are-treebanks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are Treebanks?</h3>

<p>A treebank is a dependency based sentence diagram. You can learn more about treebanking at the <a href="http://perseids.org/">Perseids</a> website. I spent the summer of 2015 producing treebanks of Plato's <em>Apology of Socrates</em> and Xenophon's <em>Apology of Socrates</em>. This was part of a larger project I did researching the applications of treebanks in Greek pedagogy. This project was funded by Tufts University as part of the Summer Scholars Initiative.</p>

<p><img src="http://drewlatimer.github.io/images/alpheios.PNG" alt='"Sic transit gloria mundi" treebanked in two different editors.'></p>

<p>This treebank shows the Latin sentence <em>Sic transit gloria mundi.</em> "So the glory of the world passes." You can see the verb <em>transit</em> is in red and marked as the predicate, the noun <em>gloria</em> is in blue-green and marked as the subject of the verb, the noun <em>mundi</em> is marked as attributive because it modifies another noun, and the adverb <em>sic</em> is orange and shown modifying the verb. Alpheios (on the left) and Arethusa (on the right) are two tools that use this same scheme to display treebanks.</p>

<a id="where-is-your-work" class="anchor" href="#where-is-your-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Where is your work?</h3>

<p>When the Plato and Xenophon treebanks have been reviewed by my adviser, Professor Marie-Claire Beaulieu, I will make them available here on this website. I will also publish tutorials on how to treebank, pilot links for checking independent treebanking work against treebanks that have undergone scholarly review, and advice for producing treebanks.</p>
