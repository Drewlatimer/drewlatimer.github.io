{"name":"Drewlatimer.me","tagline":"A website about my work in Digital Humanities","body":"### Welcome to my website.\r\nI am a student at Tufts University, in Medford Massachusetts. I study Latin and Classical Greek. My special interests are Digital Humanities, Renaissance Latin, and Indoeuropean Linguistics. The purpose of this website is to showcase my work in Digital Humanities and facilitate it in the future.\r\n\r\n### What are Digital Humanities?\r\nBroadly speaking, Digital Humanities are the application of new tools to the study of the humanities. I am especially interested in how computers can improve the study of Classical Philology. Philology is the art of reading slowly. Tools like [Alpheios](alpheios.net) and the [Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/) can let the reader analyze each word of a text, so they enable the ultimate close-reading. The Perseus Digital Library and the [Ancient Greek and Latin Treebanks](http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/) also allow a very distant reading. By this I mean that the Treebanks allow the reader to run statistical and other tests on thousands of words of Greek or Latin at a time.\r\n\r\n### What are Treebanks?\r\nA treebank is a dependency based sentence diagram. You can learn more about treebanking at the [Perseids](http://perseids.org/) website. I spent the summer of 2015 producing treebanks of Plato's Apology of Socrates and Xenophon's Apology of Socrates. This was part of a larger project I did researching the applications of treebanks in Greek pedagogy. This project was funded by Tufts University as part of the Summer Scholars Initiative.\r\n\r\n![\"Sic transit gloria mundi\" treebanked in two different editors.](http://imgur.com/Hqo3cZD)\r\n\r\n### Where is your work?\r\nWhen the Plato and Xenophon treebanks have been reviewed by my adviser, Professor Marie-Claire Beaulieu, I will make them available here on this website. I will also publish tutorials on how to treebank, pilot links for checking independent treebanking work against treebanks that have undergone scholarly review, and advice for producing treebanks.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
